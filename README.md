# Brief Introduction

Your learning path in Artificial Intelligence, including Machine Learning and Deep Learning, from zero to hero!

Hi, I'm Angga who co-founded <a href="http://aiforindonesia.org/community" target="_blank">Indonesia AI</a>. 

This learning path is intended for everyone eager to learn Artificial Intelligence and build a career in this related field especially AI Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, CV, NLP Engineer or even Data Scientist. In this guide, there is a corresponding link in some section that will help you to learn (at least to start) in each chapter.

[A chart demonstrating the path - in progress]

## 1. Basic Python

The first step to start learning AI or Machine Learning is to pick up a programming language and we recommend Python since it's so popular, easy to learn and future-ready.

## 2. Intermediate Python

Before moving on to AI or Machine Learning stuff, you should at least get familiar with top 3 most popular python libraries for it.

Getting Started: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy" target="_blank">What is NumPy?</a>

Popular Libraries: <a href="https://numpy.org/" target="_blank">NumPy</a> | <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">Pandas</a> | <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="_blank">Matplotlib</a>

1. Python Library Numpy
2. Python Library Pandas
3. Python Library Matplotlib

## 3. Machine Learning

Once you have some idea of using Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib after learning Python, you should start looking into how these machine learning (ML) algorithms work.
